# Assembly

This repo contains some assembly that I wrote in high school. The files are named poorly and the comments are... sparse.

* DNA.ASM - several utility functions used from various Pascal and QB projects
* FLIP.ASM - Line drawing and double-buffering functions
* FILE2.ASM, KOPY.ASM - Low level copy functions. Used for a DOS project I worked on that allowed better visualization of directory layout for managing files.
* PCMAN2.ASM - A PacMan-like game that I wrote with 'coder' (Phil) for a small executable contest. Goal was to have an app in exactly 666 bytes. Never finished, but has levels, movement, and 'death'. Ghosts havwe no AI though.
* PONG.ASM - A Pong-like game for the same 666 byte contest that I did finish and enter.
